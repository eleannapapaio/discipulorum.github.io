        <h2>Hello, I'm Eleanna Papaioannou</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a Computer Science student at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, but this project began back in 2022 when I was still in high school.</p>
        <p>I created Discipulorum because I noticed my classmates struggling to find extracurricular activities that matched their interests. Many talented students didn't know where to look for academic competitions, book recommendations, or university opportunities.</p>
        <p>As someone who was always searching for these opportunities myself, I wanted to create a central resource that would make this information accessible to everyone. What started as a way to help my friends has grown into a platform I hope can benefit students everywhere.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Discipulorum (Latin for "of students") was created with a simple goal: to help students discover opportunities that ignite their passions and expand their horizons.</p>
      <p>We believe every student deserves access to resources that can help them grow academically and personally. Whether it's finding the perfect book, discovering a competition in their field of interest, or learning about university programs, we want to make the search easier.</p>
      <p>This platform remains a passion project, maintained alongside my university studies. I continue to update it with new opportunities as I discover them, hoping to pay forward the help I received when I was first exploring these resources.</p>
